Part1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods in java (command line args,Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console)


Class: factorial

-> Purpose: This class is designed to find the factorial of a given number.

-> Methods:
fact(int num):

Purpose: Computes the factorial of the provided integer.

Parameters:
num: The number for which factorial is to be calculated.

Returns: The factorial of the input number.

Description: Multiplies all integers from num down to 1 to calculate its factorial.


The classes below demonstrate various methods of taking input in Java and calculating the factorial of a number using the factorial class.


Class: bufferreaderinput

-> Purpose: This class demonstrates taking input using BufferedReader to find the factorial of a number.

-> Method:
main(String[] args):

Purpose: Reads input using BufferedReader, calculates factorial using the factorial class, and prints the result.

Parameters:
args: Command-line arguments passed to the program.

Description: Reads user input using BufferedReader and calculates the factorial of the entered number using the factorial class.


Class: datainputstreaminput

-> Purpose: This class demonstrates taking input using DataInputStream to find the factorial of a number.

-> Method:
main(String[] args):

Purpose: Reads input using DataInputStream, calculates factorial using the factorial class, and prints the result.

Parameters:
args: Command-line arguments passed to the program.

Description: Reads user input using DataInputStream and calculates the factorial of the entered number using the factorial class.


Class: scannerclassinput

-> Purpose: This class demonstrates taking input using Scanner to find the factorial of a number.

-> Method:
main(String[] args):

Purpose: Reads input using Scanner, calculates factorial using the factorial class, and prints the result.

Parameters:
args: Command-line arguments passed to the program.

Description: Reads user input using Scanner and calculates the factorial of the entered number using the factorial class.


Class: commandlineinput

-> Purpose: This class demonstrates taking input from command line arguments to find the factorial of a number.

-> Method:
main(String[] args):

Purpose: Reads input from command line arguments, calculates factorial using the factorial class, and prints the result.

Parameters:
args: Command-line arguments passed to the program.

Description: Reads the input number from command line arguments and calculates the factorial using the factorial class.


Class: consoleloginput

-> Purpose: This class demonstrates taking input using Console to find the factorial of a number.

-> Method:
main(String[] args):

Purpose: Reads input using Console, calculates factorial using the factorial class, and prints the result.

Parameters:
args: Command-line arguments passed to the program.

Description: Reads user input using Console and calculates the factorial of the entered number using the factorial class.
